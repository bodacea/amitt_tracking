NATO expanded in 2017 to Montenegro and the consequences have been harmful. Montenegro no longer has an army to secure the Otranto Canal or the means to fight against the urgent threat from Islamic Jihadism.\\nTo the Western Balkans, NATO is the real danger.', \"Unfounded claims on NATO. Similar cases can be found here and here.\\nAfter Montenegro joined NATO, the defence spending in the country has increased with the intention of investing 2% of GDP in defence by 2024.\\nThe State Union of Serbia and Montenegro applied to NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme in June 2003. Montenegro declared independence on 3 June 2006, subsequently joined PfP and then NATO itself without Serbia.\\nThe reaction of the Russian government to Montenegro′s bid to join NATO had been increasingly hostile culminating in an attempt to stage a coup d'état on 16 October 2016, on the day of the parliamentary election that allegedly would have included assassination of Montenegro′s prime minister. Montenegro opened an investigation and indicted Russian GRU officers, Serbian and Montenegrin nationals.\", ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs5BAgZrQQs'], ['Reported in:\\n\\n                Issue 142', 'DATE OF PUBLICATION:\\n        24/03/2019', 'Language/target audience:\\n                                            French', 'Country:\\n            North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, US', 'Keywords:\\n            Western Balkans, EU/NATO enlargement, NATO', 'Outlet:\\n        RT France']]\n",

Unfounded claims on foreign influence on Ukraine\\'s legal system.\\nEradication of corruption was one of the main demands of the Maidan protests in 2013-2014. After the new President and Parliament were elected in Ukraine in 2014, anti-corruption reform became a key objective of a new Ukrainian government, which was agreed on in a Coalition Agreement (part 3).\\nAs a result, the new Parliament created two new independent anti-corruption bodies. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine is a law enforcement agency responsible for preventing, detecting, terminating, investigating and disclosing corruption offenses committed by senior officials.\\nThe specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office is a prosecutorial body, which functions independently from the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine. Its main tasks include prosecution of the crimes and supervision during pre-trial investigations conducted by National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine.\\nThe EU supports anti-corruption reform in Ukraine. During an EU-Ukraine Summit in July 2018, the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker noted: “For us, the fight against corruption is an important duty for Ukraine, relevant. I will never say that Ukraine is a corrupt country, but there is corruption in Ukraine, just like in other countries. And we really pay a lot of attention to the fight against corruption, including to the steps that the Ukrainian authorities are taking\".\\nIn her visit to Ukraine in March 2018, High Representative/Vice President of the EU Federica Mogherini mentioned: “The anti-corruption institutions must be allowed to do their work independently, with enough powers and resources to investigate, prosecute and eventually ensure the conviction of those responsible for corruption.”\\nU.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch also stresses the need to safeguard independence of the newly created anti-corruption authorities and to “establishing an anti-corruption court of the highest integrity, based on the Venice Commission’s opinion.”', ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlkxbYZy6J4&t=2577s'], ['Reported in:\\nIssue 139', 'DATE OF PUBLICATION:\\n        28/02/2019', 'Language/target audience:\\n                                                                Russian, Ukrainian', 'Country:\\n            Ukraine, US', 'Keywords:\\n            Ukraine, EU, Corruption, Euromaidan', 'Outlet:\\n        Podiyi Dnya z Tyhranom Martyrosyanom @ Nash TV Channel - (17:02-17:34)']]\n",
