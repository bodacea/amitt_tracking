He is accused of taking an existing product called “Trinity Remedy” kit and renaming it the “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment.” The Food and Drug Administration has issued multiple warnings in recent weeks to companies “for selling unapproved products claiming to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19,” according to press releases. There is currently no known cure for the potentially fatal virus. The most effective way to avoid coronavirus is to practice social distancing and wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for 20 seconds or longer, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.",04/03/2020,MSN,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/bogus-coronavirus-cure-with-peroxide-and-prayer-leads-to-smugglers-arrest-ice-says/ar-BB126abA,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020

4,Myth,Stay away from Chinese (or otherwise Asian) people because they have the coronavirus,"The false claim is: ""Stay away from Chinese (or otherwise Asian) people because they have the coronavirus."" This is not true! It is important to remember that people – including those of Asian descent – who do not live in or have not recently been in an area of ongoing spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, or have not been in contact with a person who is a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are not at greater risk of spreading COVID-19 than other Americans. Public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are stressful times for people and communities. Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to social stigma(1) toward people, places, or things. For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease. Stigma can also occur after a person has been released from COVID-19 quarantine even though they are not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others.",04/03/2020,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/reducing-stigma.html?,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020

6,Myth,An N95 respirator and a surgical mask provide the same protection against coronavirus and COVID-19,"The false claim is: ""An N95 respirator and a surgical mask provide the same protection against coronavirus and COVID-19."" This is false. A NIOSH-approved N95 respirator forms a seal against the user's face, preventing particle penetration around the edges. The filter has passed NIOSH test to determine that it protects against at least 95% of airborne particles. Because surgical masks do not seal against the face and the filters have not been tested, the same level of protection against airborne particles cannot be guaranteed. Misinformation sources are citing an article in Nature titled, ""Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks"" that reports on the testing of the masks; but the misinformation sources fail to state what the authors of the research do in their paper: ""Uncertainties similarly apply to the modes of transmission of COVID-19,"" and suggesting that only that ""...surgical face masks could be used by ill people to reduce onward transmission.""",04/02/2020,buzzfeednews,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/coronavirus-face-mask-cdc-n95-surgical-fabric-homemade,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020
7,Myth,Chinese authorities found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus,"The false claim is: ""Chinese authorities found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus.""

The actual tweet said: ""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China."" Now the World Health Organization (WHO) lists the truth about the coronavirus on it's website: ""Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.",04/02/2020,WHO,https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020
8,Myth,Service animals and pets can spread the coronavirus to humans,"The false claim is: ""Service animals and pets can spread the coronavirus to humans."" Please don't abandon your pets! The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sates: ""Some coronaviruses that infect animals have become able to infect humans and then spread between people, but this is rare. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are examples of diseases caused by coronaviruses that originated in animals and spread to people. This is what is suspected to have happened with the virus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19. However, we do not know the exact source of this virus. Public health officials and partners are working hard to identify the source of COVID-19. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person to person. The coronavirus most similar to the virus causing COVID-19 is the one that causes SARS. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 or that they might be a source of infection in the United States."" Additionally, the American Veterinary Medical Association states: ""While 2 dogs (Hong Kong) and 1 cat (Belgium) have been reported to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets spread COVID-19 to other animals, including people. If you are not ill with COVID-19, you can interact with your pet as you normally would, including walking, feeding, and playing. You should continue to practice good hygiene during those interactions (e.g., wash hands before and after interacting with your pet; ensure your pet is kept well-groomed; regularly clean your pet’s food and water bowls, bedding material, and toys). Out of an abundance of caution, it is recommended that those ill with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. Have another member of your household take care of walking, feeding, and playing with your pet. If you have a service animal or you must care for your pet, then wear a facemask; don’t share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with them.""",04/02/2020,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fanimals.html,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020

Interferon alpha-2b has been used to treat some earlier strains of coronavirus, but it’s not a vaccine that would prevent people from getting Covid-19. Vaccines are a treatment to prevent disease, explains the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease … But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don’t make you sick.” The CDC adds: “A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.” According to the World Health Organization, there are still “no specific vaccines or treatments for Covid-19”. “Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat Covid-19,” says the organisation.

There are even reports that the advice came from Stanford University, but that's completely false according to the med school. Truth: While it's possible for the coronavirus to cause fibrosis, holding your breath is not a suitable at-home ""test"" to determine if you have lung damage.

Swine flu was first detected in the United States in 2009, and MERS was first identified in Jordan in 2012, according to the CDC. The CDC says the first cases of SARS were reported in China's Guangdong province in 2002. Drew Brandewie, Cornyn's communications director, said on Thursday that the senator ""misspoke"" about the origins of MERS and swine flu, but the rest of his comments referred to the animal markets. Cornyn met a swift backlash on Twitter for his comments. ""Can we go back to when being racist in public wasn’t cool?"" said Democratic attorney and politician Bakari Sellers on Twitter. The National Council of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, a coalition of 35 national Asian American Pacific Islander advocacy groups, replied directly to Cornyn, writing, ""there are over 1M Asian Americans in your state.

103,Myth,The coronavirus came from outer space,"The false claim is: ""The coronavirus came from outer space."" With the coronavirus pandemic continuing to spread around the globe, people are panicked, and they're looking for answers and explanations. One wild theory that has made its way around the web is that the virus came from space. Recently, Chandra Wickramasinghe, known for his work in astronomy and astrobiology, spread the idea that the virus was living on a comet and a piece of that space rock may have fallen to Earth during a brief fireball event over China in October 2019. He further implied that comets carrying viruses may have caused outbreaks in the past as well. In the past, Wickramasinghe has asserted that another disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) also came from space. He even co-wrote a book with Fred Hoyle in the 1970s called ""Diseases from Space"" and, for decades, has tried to prove that diseases like SARS or influenza have come from space. However, scientists have rebuked Wickramasinghe's suggestions that any such illness might have extraterrestrial origins, and his ideas have largely been considered pseudoscience or ""bad science."" It would be unprecedented to discover that a virus could survive the radiation it would be exposed to on such a long journey through space (never mind the trip back to Earth) and still be able to infect humans after it landed, astrobiologist Graham Lau, who hosts NASA's ""Ask an Astrobiologist"" series, told Space.com. However, while it would be an incredibly unique and groundbreaking finding if this were true, Wickramasinghe simply does not have evidence to support his claims, Lau said. ""It's one of those cases where extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" Lau told Space.com. ""Even though it's an interesting idea, we just don't have any reason to embrace that idea right now. ""I think it's important for scientists to point out pseudoscientists or bad science,"" Lau added. ""If this was real, it'd be great, but we just can't allow ourselves to jump to the feel-good conclusion without doing our due diligence as scientists.""",03/17/2020,space,https://www.space.com/coronavirus-not-from-outer-space.html,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020

Coronavirus did not spread in the US because of an anti-Trump conspiracy. In a March 10 episode of the podcast “The NutriMedical Report,” commentator Josh Bernstein claimed the spread of COVID-19 in the United States was the result of a conspiracy between the Democratic Party and Chinese government. “I believe that because Russia didn’t work, and Ukraine didn’t work, and impeachment didn’t work, they are so hell-bent on destroying this country (and) this president to gain back power that they probably worked with the Chinese government, and they devised this plan,” Bernstein said. During the episode, Bernstein also claimed Democrats and the Chinese government used the “medical deep state” to spread the virus among the American public to “scare the living daylights out of everybody to shut down the economy, to shut down the markets and to stop the Trump rallies.”",03/17/2020,usatoday,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/17/fact-check-coronavirus-spread-not-anti-trump-conspiracy/5065736002/,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020

One of many recurring Kremlin disinformation narratives claiming that the outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus is man-made. COVID-19 is not a biological weapon.

An article recently published on the Hubei government's website and deleted a few hours later suggests that there is a """"theoretical"""" risk to men's reproductive health. Dire consequences are rare unless people have chronic cardiovascular or respiratory illnesses.

In March 2020, as the COVID-19 coronavirus disease continued to spread around the globe, worried citizens started to stock up on supplies to “wait out the storm” in the relative safety of their homes. As store shelves were temporarily emptied, a viral message started to circulate on social media that claimed anyone looking for baby formula during this pandemic could obtain some by simply calling the number on the back of one of these products. This viral meme reads: “For parents who cannot find formula in stores for their babies right now grab the can of formula that you do have, and call the number on the back and they will send you a whole case during this time!” This is not true. You can’t receive a free case of baby formula simply by calling the number on the back of a product. This claim appears to have originated out of whole cloth (which means that it is a lie). One red flag that indicates this post contains faulty advice is that no specific company is identified in the message. We searched the websites of some of the larger baby formula brands, such as Gerber and Enfamil, and found no announcements about how parents could obtain baby formula via this method during the pandemic.

This is being promulgated by government at every level, by so-called national and world health organizations, and by a complicit media that seemingly does as it is told by those holding political power. This is being done regardless of the fact that no one knows much about this so-called virus, knows little or nothing about its true origin, and knows little about its mutations. Also, politicians, claimed authorities, and alleged experts are in the dark as to how particular cultures have been more susceptible than others, and are unwilling to discuss that the probable cause of this is due to a man-made strain created in a bio-weapons lab, even though a preponderance of evidence points in that direction. All possibilities should be discussed. Has all this panic been planned? The impending economic collapse caused by the Federal Reserve and its massive money printing is most likely going to be falsely blamed on the coronavirus, so what is the connection? Was this virus created for the purpose of covering up responsibility for an economic meltdown? Was it created to harm the economy of China and Iran?

As scientists race to find a cure and vaccine, China is increasingly turning to its traditional remedies. Other TCM remedies that are being touted are buffalo horn, cow poop, kimchi, bear bile, and many others. There is no known cure for the coronavirus. Scientists are working to find ways to stamp out the deadly virus. But for now, the mainstream antiviral treatments focus on relieving the symptoms, which is where some of these TCM remedies may help. Again, however, TCM is NOT ""a solution"" to the coronavirus. Beginning on January 28, 2020, Chinese state media began an information campaign on the social media platform Webo to support their claims of the effectiveness of TCM. The four Weibo posts marked the beginning of a long lasting campaign to support the claim that TCM was key to fighting COVID-19. Over the ensuing three months, Chinese state media posted 201 times across 55 accounts on the subject. The posts appeared on Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, RSS, Instagram, Weibo, and Twitter. In line with China’s IO campaign “Chinese Scientific Prowess Coveted Around The World” (2019-11-18 to 2020-02-12 with 3,751 posts), the focus on TCM’s efficacy was international.

A prominent Chinese official has promoted a conspiracy theory that the United States military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China -- and it did not originate in the city of Wuhan, as thought. Posting to his more than 300,000 followers on Twitter, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian republished a video of Robert Redfield, the director for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, addressing a US Congressional committee on March 11. In the clip, Redfield said some influenza deaths in the US were later identified as cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Redfield didn't say when those people had died or over what time period, but Zhao pointed to his remarks in support of a growing conspiracy theory that the coronavirus did not originate in Hubei province in central China. He did not offer any further evidence for the claim. There is no evidence backing the idea that SARS-CoV-2 originated from US servicemembers visiting Wuhan. Researchers have concluded that the novel coronavirus is not a human creation because it does not share any ""previously used virus backbone.""

The liberal-democratic societies of the West have not â€œenabled the spreadâ€ of coronavirus. The scientific community in these societies and around the world is striving to understand the dangerous respiratory disease COVID-19 (the coronavirus disease) and the virus that causes it. Such scientific knowledge will be critical in bringing the coronavirus pandemic under control. Historically liberal societies have been at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs that have brought about tremendous advancements in public health in the 19th and 20th centuries. The development of modern science in the West, including the growth of scientific knowledge about the causes and the means of controlling disease, is closely related to liberalism. Scientific research flourishes in liberal societies, because science relies on openness, free speech, and the freedom to associate with other thinkers.

Covid-19 is in fact an ordinary viral disease with a slightly higher mortality from complications for people of old age or people with weakened immunity. Another open secret is that the current hysteria over the outbreak is being successfully used by some players to achieve their own economic and geopolitical goals. Looking at the current situation in Europe, one could suppose that some forces have seized an opportunity and are now fueling the coronavirus crisis intentionally."" This is a conspiracy theory, presented with no evidence to support the claim that the coronavirus crisis is being intentionally exploited for economic and geopolitical goals. This is a continuation of pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts about the coronavirus outbreak, aiming to put blame on the West for allegedly exploiting the outbreak for their own purposes, namely isolating China. While many baseless conspiracy theories have emerged all around the world amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, there is no evidence that Western media are deliberately promoting them with malign intent. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that pro-Kremlin media are spreading disinformation on the disease for political purposes through a coordinated campaign. The mortality rate of the coronavirus has varied by country and estimates differ, however, it is more deadly than most strains of the flu. Since it is a new disease, humans do not have any immunity to it. The rapid spread of the virus around the world threatens to overwhelm public health systems, particularly in poorer countries, resulting in more deaths and other adverse societal and economic impacts. In a statement on 5 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation drove home the gravity of the situation, saying: ""this epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor.

200,Myth,Coronavirus is an attempt by the Anglo-Saxons to control China,"The false claim is: ""Coronavirus is linked to the opium wars when Chinese emperors wanted to prevent the access of the British empire to Chinese domestic ports. China’s opening up happened through the active spread of opium. Today, similarly, international organisations and private medical foundations openly call on China to give them access to Chinese industrial zones saying: we will sort it out ourselves and find a vaccination. This, which the Anglo-Saxons are good at, serves as a method of opening China up and establishing external control over it."" This is a coronavirus-related conspiracy theory aimed to discredit the West and the so-called Anglo-Saxons. In the pro-Kremlin media, the term “Anglo-Saxons” means “evil”, “belligerent” and “morally corrupt” Westerners, as explained by our earlier analysis. The Opium Wars were a dark page in the British Empire and, more generally, in the West's history. However, the parallels with the current coronavirus epidemic are unfounded and only serve to groundlessly imply that the West purposefully uses it against China to reach economic and political goals. The current coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a family of viruses that include other viruses such as SARS and MERS. It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China and has been rapidly spreading with new cases being reported in the Asian-Pacific region as well as Europe, North America and the Middle East, causing more than 700 deaths by 10th February 2020. The identity of the animal source of the coronavirus, named nCoV-2019, has been one of the key questions for researchers. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats. One of the previous coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread from bats to civet cats to humans.

201,Myth,"Coronavirus was created on purpose, probably by the same British lab which poisoned the Skripals","The false narrative is: ""There is evidence that the coronavirus was created on purpose. First of all, both the US and the UK have announced the existence of a vaccine. But any expert knows that it’s not possible to create a vaccine against a virus, which was never seen before. In UK the Porton Down laboratory, a quite well known organisation which has been dealing with chemical and biological weapons for a long time has said they already have the vaccine. According to media, they have patented it already one year ago! This is the same organisation which put the poison on the Skripals’ door handle. Probably they put something also over the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, for example, on the door handle of the subway, or rather not the door handle but this one [thing, object] which is being touched by thousands of people. Unfortunately, we can’t exclude such a situation. It can be an act of biological sabotage, it might have been carried out not by a State, for example, the US, but by certain private corporations. The appearance of such beneficiaries able to go on market already tomorrow with an already made vaccine is a not direct proof of that.""

The idea of the teachings is simple – globalization in the name of salvation. Well-known pharmaceutical giants and the Pentagon representatives took part in this exercise. The timing of the exercise cannot be a coincidence: when the exercises were conducted, the coronavirus did not exist. It should either be Nostradamus, or a person who created it [the virus]. Therefore, these exercises directly confirm Gates’s involvement in this problem."" This is a conspiracy theory and a pro-Kremlin narrative about the coronavirus and Bill Gates. There was in fact an exercise “Event 201” that took place in October that was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, that focused on emergency preparedness in the event of a ""severe pandemic."" But it didn’t make real-life predictions about death tolls. ""To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction.

A large US military delegation, consisting of 300 people, arrived in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China on October 19, 2019, to participate in a military games festival hosted by China and held there. On November 2, 2019, the first infection with the coronavirus was recorded in that province, and it spread rapidly throughout December. Scientifically, the incubation period for corona infection is 14 days."" A number of conspiracy theories that are only linked by the fact that they are ""separate"" incidents, and echos some recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation especially about China coronavirus. The narratives also resemble a recurring conspiracy theory about the Lugar Lab in Georgia. The claims about Canadian involvement in the coronavirus spread appear to be based on a mischaracterization of August 2019 reports about a transfer of Ebola and Nipah viruses from a Canadian lab to Beijing, and an apparently separate issue involving two Chinese researchers at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, in the central province of Manitoba. Read further debunking by the AFP Fact Check. As for the US participation in the Military World Games and its connection with the coronavirus, there is no evidence to prove this claim. There were 9,308 athletes from 109 countries that have registered to participate in 2019 Military World Games held between October 18-27. While the incubation period of 2019-nCoV, also known as coronavirus, is believed to vary from as few as 2 days to as long as 14 days after the exposure, according to the CDC. This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS viruses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first reported unusual cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan was recorded on 31 December 2019, when Chinese authorities confirmed they wereinvestigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, which is 65 days after the closing ceremony of the Military World Games.",02/01/2020,euvsdisinfo,https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/coronavirus-a-north-american-epidemic/,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020

The claim that the United States has patented and owns the coronavirus goes back to viral incorrect claims that the virus, along with its vaccine is owned by the Pirbright Institute (a research institute in the UK), was funded by the American Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The institute works to prevent viral diseases of livestock. The Pirbright Institute clarified that they don’t work with human coronaviruses and that a patent that they hold is unrelated to the current coronavirus linked to Wuhan. The patent that the story links to - No. 10,130,701 - is for a mutated form of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a different coronavirus that infects poultry, but not people. That patent was filed by the Pirbright Institute, but not funded by the Gates Foundation, and the mutations were created to weaken the virus so that it could be used as a vaccine to protect chickens from IBV. Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland, told FactCheck.org that the patent has nothing to do with the new 2019-nCoV virus. The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention explains that the name of new coronavirus comes from the crown, or corona-like appearance of infective viruses when seen under a microscope. The CDC told the Associated Press in 2003 that the agency was claiming ownership of a patent related to a virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease that spread to dozens of countries in 2003, in result of which more than 8,000 people got ill and 774 people died), in order to ensure access and to prevent others from controlling the technology.",02/01/2020,euvsdisinfo,https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/us-owns-the-coronavirus-and-its-cure/,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020

When the virus emerged from the laboratory and a serious pandemic began, the United States refused to provide information about its work to the Indonesian Ministry of Health."" This is not the first time the claims that the United States is creating a biological weapon appear. It has been stated before in several pro-kremlin articles and talk shows, especially to comment on the story onSkripal poisoning and also todiscredit the account of Yulia Skripal. The comments about the US creating a biological weapon against Russians come from Igor Nikulin, who is usually presented as a former inspector of the UN Commission on Chemical, Bacteriological and Biological Weapons. According to Russian website “the Insider”, Nikulin has no connection with the UN. Furthermore, on his website, Nikulin describes himself as a supporter of a monarchy in Russia and proclaims his alleged descent from the ancient Rurik dynasty. In early 2008, the Indonesian Health Minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, has claimed in her book, that the United States and the World Health Organisation are part of aglobal conspiracy to profit from the spread of bird flu and the US may use samples to produce biological weapons. Because much of the claims were groundless, the president of the country ordered the Book to be withdrawn from the market. And after publishing an English version of the same book, the Indonesian Minister of Health stated that the book shall be also withdrawn from the market. Siti Fadilah claimed that there were ""mistranslated phrases that don't match the Indonesian version"", and therefore the book needed to be retracted.",01/23/2020,euvsdisinfo,https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-new-corona-virus-is-a-us-biological-weapon/,Zero Hedge,04/03/2020
251,Myth,A new Chinese coronavirus was likely elaborated in NATO biolabs,"The false narrative is: ""A new coronavirus coincides with a number of significant events in the world, including the WEF’s Davos Forum in Switzerland. It must not be a coincidence, just as it was with H1N1 virus and others. This is all business aimed at the creation of specific political and economic situation. There are many American and NATO biological laboratories around China. They study human saliva, the genome of humans representing specific race. Japanese media write that the new virus infects only Chinese. Global fights are not ethical, everything can be used. Back into 1950-1960s, China released posters saying: “Everyone to struggle with American bacteriological aggression!”, this is coming back. Soon the new coronavirus will be linked to ecology… They will say that the presence of European specialists at Chinese industrial enterprises is needed in order for the Chinese goods to be exported to the US and Europe."" This is a conspiracy theory aimed to cast a shadow at the US / NATO as likely purposeful creators of the new virus pursuing political and economic aims. So far nothing suggests that this was the case. Coronaviruses are well known to science. They are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses, rarely evolving and spreading from animals to humans. In a new study in the Journal of Medical Virology, researchers sequenced the genes of 2019-nCoV (as the new coronavirus is now called) and suggested that 2019-nCoV likely originated in snakes.
